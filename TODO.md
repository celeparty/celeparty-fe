# Ticket Product Issues Fix Plan

## Issues to Fix:

1. **Home Page**: Ticket products not showing
2. **Products Page**: Ticket products not showing
3. **Vendor Edit**: Cannot edit ticket products in vendor dashboard
4. **Management Ticket Send Invitation**: Not showing ticket products
5. **Product Detail**: Cannot view ticket product details

## Analysis:

- Ticket products are implemented but may have filtering/state issues
- Send Invitation tab fetches products instead of tickets
- Product detail pages may need type parameter for tickets

## Tasks:

1. [ ] Verify ticket approval status and publishing
2. [ ] Fix Send Invitation tab to fetch tickets instead of products
3. [ ] Ensure product detail URLs include type parameter for tickets
4. [ ] Test edit functionality for tickets
5. [ ] Verify home and products pages show tickets
